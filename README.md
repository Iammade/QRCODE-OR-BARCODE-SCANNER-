The  "Student  Dashboard  Monitoring  using  QR  Scanner"  project  revolutionizes  student information management in educational institutions by utilizing QR code technology. Each student receives a unique QR code, which, when scanned, retrieves their personal and academic information from a centralized database. This system enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and security of handling student data.
The primary goal is to streamline access and updates to student records, eliminating manual data entry and minimizing errors. The system ensures that student information is current and easily accessible, facilitating  real-time  monitoring  of  personal  details,  academic  details,  and  complaints  against students. This not only saves time for students and administrative staff but also improves overall student data management.
QR  codes  offer  a  secure  method  for  data  access,  protecting  sensitive  information  through authenticated scans. This integration fosters better communication and coordination among students, faculty, and administrative departments.
In summary, this project aims to create a more organized, responsive, and user-friendly educational environment  by leveraging  QR  scanner  technology  for  efficient  and  secure  student  dashboard monitoring. This innovation is set to significantly enhance the management and accessibility of student information in educational settings.

Tools and Technologies:
1.   QR code generator libraries (ZXing, QRCode.js)
2.   2.   QR scanner SDKs (Scandit, Dynamsoft)
3.   Front-end and Back-end frameworks (flask)

Implementation Steps:

•      Frontend Development: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design a user-friendly result page.
•      Responsive Design: Ensure the page is responsive and accessible across different devices and screen sizes.
•      Navigation: Implement navigation logic to allow users to move between Personal Details, Professional Details, and Complaints sections.
